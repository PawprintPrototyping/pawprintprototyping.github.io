We will be happy to show you around, show off some broad strokes of our various equipment, and even help you utilize our resources for your own education and ideas.</p> <p>When you arrive, you'll first need to fill out a release of liability - there  is a chromebook near the entrance you can fill that out on, or backup blank copies on clipboards near the door for your convenience. Since this is an active workshop, we recommend wearing close-toed shoes, and to be mindful of the tools and equipment that may be about.</p> <p>If you are interested in using equipment during your stay, we're happy to help.  Most of our larger equipment requires a short certification and orientation to be enjoyed safely, but hand tools are generally available for quick fixes.</p> <p>Pawprint Prototyping is a registered California 501(c)3 non-profit, and relies totally on donations from members and viewers like  you - we encourage anyone that finds the space enjoyable to leave a small donation via our PayPal donation portal.</p> <p>Members enjoy access to the space for $100/month.
