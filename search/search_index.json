It can be commanded to do so wirelessly, using the 433 MHz keypad in the kitchen or the wireless exit button in the main space.  It also has a wired connector which will open the door when the pins are shorted.  Home Assistant can command the microcontroller to do this, through a relay to protect the MCU's GPIOs.  The most common way Home Assistant will do this is when the exterior door is opened by the Fanvil keypad, because then HA will run automation to open the interior door (after a brief delay). </p> <p>Sensing the door status: The microcontroller senses the door open/closed status.  The VIS-3200 controller is not involved, even though it has an input for it and supports forced open alarms.  There's a magnet on the door, and a magnetic sensor on the magstrike.  The magnetic sensor is a simple normally-open switch.  This is connected to a GPIO on the microcontroller, which exposes the state of the switch to Home Assistant to tell whether the door is open or not.</p>"},{"location":"magstrike/#circuit-diagram","title":"Circuit Diagram","text":"<pre><code> D1 Mini\n+-------+\n|       |\n|   D4  O----------(blue)----------O (relay  input) O---&gt; +12V \n|       |                            [   RELAY    ]                      VIS-3200\n|       |                          O (relay output) O                 +------------+\n|   D3  O----(green)----+          |                +----(green)------O Open  +12V O-----(red)-----&gt; +12V\n|       |               |          +----------(black)-----------------O Gnd    Gnd O-----(black)---&gt; ground \n+-------+               |                                             |            |\n                 [Door sensor]               + -------------(red)-----O Lock+      |\n                        |                    |              +-(black)-O Ground     |\n                        v              [ MAGSTRIKE ]        |         +------------+\n                     ground                  +-----------+  |\n                                                         v  v\n                                                        ground\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"magstrike/#users","title":"Users","text":"<p>The VIS-3200 has been programmed with two unlimited-use users, #1 and #69, which have PIN codes based on non-random numbers found in popular culture.

For cutting, especially thick material, you will need to adjust the Z-height to the center of the material.  However since the auto-focus sets the height of the bed to the surface, and won't let you back-drive the bed to Z &lt; 0, you will need to place another piece of material of the same thickness before using the auto-focus, and then back-drive the bed down (3/2) \u00d7 (material thickness).</p> <p>You can also manually level by jogging the Z up and down, and using the short end of the small piece of acrylic on the laser key as a gauge.</p> <p>Always ensure there is material under the autofocus probe.
