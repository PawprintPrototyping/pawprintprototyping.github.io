# Field trip!

_(In which Pawprint visits the elders of the internet.)_

This week's in-person meeting was a field trip to [The Commonwealth Club](https://www.commonwealthclub.org/) to see an interview featuring [Brewster Khale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Kahle) and [Sir Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/) on [Building and Preserving the Web](https://www.commonwealthclub.org/events/2025-10-09/building-and-preserving-web-conversation-sir-tim-berners-lee-and-brewster-kahle).

In-person attendees: Rechner, Geo, Christen.

The talk was excelent, we learned some new things about the founders of web technologies.  It has inspired us to take back the decentralized web from corporate interests and focus on web technologies that promote data soverignty and free expression.  It was so cool to hear Brewster and Tim's stories of both working on separate systems around the same time with the aim to give every person access to the biggest library in the world at their desk, Brewster working on [WAIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_information_server) via Thinking Machines, and Tim working on http and the web at CERN.

After the talk, Christen found these great resources obtained from the legendary Louis Rossmann: consumerrights.wiki, and wiki.futo.orgâ€”a massive wiki for setting up digital sovereignty
