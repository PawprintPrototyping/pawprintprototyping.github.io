## Sergio Identity/SSO

[SSO Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HoN24snQCYOt9xFB-Wq-UdIFRVFuR3dacJNMlAEgS2I/edit?usp=drivesdk)

We'll be doing a live demo setting up KanIDM
~4 years at cloudflare, lots of identity products

DNS is the root of trust for identity

Phishing-resistant MFA: Multi-factor authentication that can't be obtained by tricking a user into obtaining

### What can identity do for you?
- SSO for all internal and external apps
- Central logging

### IdP options
- Cloud hosted: Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, Google Identity
- Self-hosted: Kanidm, keycloak, Zitadel, Authelia

Kanidm uniquely does not enable passwords by default.

### Demo
- Spun up a VM with Kanidm running in Docker, and did a quick demo registering a user with a passkey.

## DHTs

Building an abstract network on top of another network (overlay network).  For downloading linux distros.

### Chord (protocol)

Legacy, built as a ring (boo hiss) rings suck because rings can split or join accidentally (net split, network variant)

### Kademlia

Used by Bittorrent, others
Network invariant
