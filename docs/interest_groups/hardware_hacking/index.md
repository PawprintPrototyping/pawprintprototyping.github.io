# Hardware Hacking Nights

_Don't turn it on, take it apart!_
Come learn how consumer electronics works by getting hands-on with interesting hardware.
Unique topics every week, and time for anyone to share what they're tinkering with, share
reverse engineering knowledge, void warranties, and breathe new life into hardware destined
for the landfill with a little skill and some [hacker spirit](https://www.askapache.com/hacking/hacker-manifesto/).


* Meets the 1st, 3rd, and 4th Wednesday of every month 18:30 - 21:30
* [Join the Hardware Hackers Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/ZzqAUHtH5U)

Hosted by [Tanuki](https://t.me/Noooooooki).
