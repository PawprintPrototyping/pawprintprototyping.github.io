# Description

This is an air compressor.  It takes in regular air and outputs spicy (or "caliente") air.

# Safety and Certification

- :material-safety-goggles: 
* Always use eye, hearing, and hands PPE when using any compressed air system, especially tools.  This means goggles, earplugs or head cans, and gloves at a minimum.  
* For some procedures, also consider using an impact apron and blast shield.

## Hazards

!!! danger

    Air compressors, especially this one, output high pressure air that can harm or kill you, sometimes with delayed effect.  This is because it is possible to force an air bubble through the skin into the bloodstream, where it can travel to the heart and cause fatal cardiac arrest.

## Prohibited Operations

Do not use the air compressor to perform any of the following dangerous procedures.  All of these are prohibited without prior written authorization.

* Pneumatic Recreation Protocol
* Airborne Occupational Enrichment Exercise
* The Shop Floor Stress Test
* Atmospheric Integrity Calibration
* OSHA Compliance Challenge
* High-speed ergonomic adjustments
* Rapid Airborne Motivation Event (RAME)
* Fluid Dynamics Team-Bonding Exercise


## Pre-flight checklist

* Put on hearing, eye, and hands PPE.
* Carefully go upstairs.
* Follow all signs on the compressor before starting it up, especially checking the oil.
* Pay out the air hose over the balcony in a controlled manner to avoid damaging the hose fittings and anything below.  Call out "rock" when you do this.
* Plug the air compressor power cord into the orange extension cord near the stairs.
* Turn the air compressor on with the red-tipped switch.
* Check for air leaks upstairs.
* Go downstairs and check for air leaks downstairs.  If you find any leaks, turn off the compressor, unplug it, repair the leaks with teflon tape or another suitable method, then restart this procedure.

## Operation checklist

* Put on hearing, eye, and hands PPE.
* Attach your tools to the air hose.
* Use the tools according to the manufacturer's directions.

## Post-flight checklist

* Put on hearing, eye, and hands PPE.
* Carefully go upstairs and turn off the compressor with the red-tipped switch.
* Unplug the power cord from the extension cord.
* Get prone, then use the shop towel below the compressor to turn the purge valve at the very bottom of the air tank clockwise (because it is probably facing away from you) to open the valve.  Do not keep any part of your body, especially your bare fingers, underneath the cylindrical purge exhaust the valve is attached to.
* Monitor the air and water purge.  Occasionally water will clog the purge output and you will have to wiggle the purge valve to help break the surface tension and allow the rest of the air to come out.
* When there is zero purge exhaust, even if you wiggle the purge valve some more, turn it counterclockwise to close the valve.
* Neatly coil up the power cord and air hose for the next user.
