Metcal produces professional soldering stations which consist of an high-frequency power source and a fixed-temperature cartridge which [harnesses skin-effect and currie point to regulate temperature](https://www.metcal.com/soldering-station/how-smartheat-technology-works-a-tutorial/).  A big advantage of this is quick thermal recovery and very stable temperature regulation, since temperature regulation is a part of the physical properties of the heater cartridge itself responding directly to thermal loads.

The temperature is regulated by the properties of the cartridge tip itself, there are no controls except the power switch.

### Tips

The MX-RM3E handpiece is compatible with STTC- or SMTC-series tips and cartridges.

Some crowd favourites are:
* SMTC-1147 3.3mm hoof
* SMTC-0167 1.52mm hoof

The flat surface is great for maximum heat transfer.  Friends don't let friends struggle with a conical tip.


## Hakko FR-300 Desoldering Tool

[Manual](/manuals/electronics/fr300e20150414.pdf)

Lives in a hard plastic case on the shelf of the electronics bench, along with a dedicated stand.  This is a very nice desoldering gun that makes removal of through-hole components a breeze.  Operation is straightforward, but please read the Operation guide in the manual before using.

Cleaning is extremely important and should be done frequently during the desoldering process, before putting the iron away.  The case includes a cleaning pin.  Empty the cartridge and clean the tip and heating core before putting the tool away.  Let the electronics bench captain know if it needs any additional consumables (paper air filters, tips, missing cleaning tools).
