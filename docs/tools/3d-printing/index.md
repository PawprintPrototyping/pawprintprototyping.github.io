Pawprint has a variety of both FDM (filament) and SLA (resin) 3D printers available for use.  Each printer should have a name label and corresponding wiki page here describing its care and feeding.

Before using any of the 3D printers, you must complete the appropriate induction class.  This short intro class will cover basic operations of the slicer, material compatibility, and safety requirements.

## Materials

We usually keep a quantity of PLA and PET filament around in various colors to facilitate small print jobs.  If you plan on spinning up a small trinkets factory, printing a giant leg, or generally are running FDM prints with slice times more than a few hours, we ask that you either supply your own filament, or earmark ~$1/hr of print time for the 3D printer fund, and notify the area captain of any run-outs.

!!! danger "Hazards"
    * 3D printers get hot when operating!  Check the temperature on the screen before touching the bed or hot-end.
    * Wait for the bed to cool to < 40C before removing a print or handling the bed sheet.
    * Some materials are incompatible with certain bed sheet types.  Check the compatibility chart before printing.
    * Some materials, like ABS and ASA, produce fumes and fine particulates when heated, and must be printed in an enclosure.
    * Failed prints can come detatched and damage printers.  Stop any failed prints and let someone know in the Telegram chat.

## Pre-flight checklist

1. Check that the build plate is clear, and cleaned.
2. A dirty or greasy build-plate will not have good bed adhesion.  All build plates can be cleaned with hot water and dish soap, and dried between use.  Some can be degreased with Isopropyl Alcohol (check their icons!).
3. Load or confirm the correct filament is loaded, that the material selection matches on the printer, and that the [build plate is compatible with your material](https://help.prusa3d.com/filament-material-guide).

## Operation checklist

1. Watch for completion of the first layer.  The first layer adhesion is usually the most error-prone part of the process.
2. Check on the printer every 30 minutes if you're on-site.  If you intend to leave a long print unattended, put your name in the g-code file and post in the Telegram chat as a courtesy.
3. Regularly check that your print hasn't detatched from the build plate, or turned into a bowl of spaghetti.

## Post-flight checklist

1. Wait for the print bed to cool down before removing it.
2. Gently flex the print bed to release your object.  You may need to use a plastic scraper to help.
3. Clean any loose bits of filament including the purge line.
4. Clean the build plate with isopropyl (after checking for compatibility!).  If there are fingerprints or visible marks on the plate, wash the build plate in the sink with hot, soapy water, and dry with a paper towel before replacing it on the printer.
