# Description

Our lathe is a Central Machinery 7x10 mini lathe (93212). This machine is capable of precisely machining most common metals, although it excels in brass and aluminum.

# Safety and Certification

!!! info "Protective Equipment"
    - :material-safety-goggles: **Safety glasses**:  Proper safety glasses are required at all times.
    - **Ear protection**: May occasionally be needed for particularly screechy operations.
    - **Respirator**:  Recommended if using large amounts of cutting oil.
    - **DO NOT WEAR GLOVES**:  They can get caught in the lathe causing serious injury.

!!! danger "Hazards"
    * **High-torque device**: Lathes, even small ones, can easily remove fingers. Keep hands away from moving parts.
    * **Do NOT wear gloves** during operation, as they can get caught in the lathe.
    * **No dangly bits**: Long sleeves, long hair, loose clothing and jewelry can easily get caught in the lathe causing serious injury. Long hair must be tied up.
    * **Sharp chips**: Metal shavings are razor sharp and very hot. Use gloves when cleaning them up (but NOT while the lathe is running)
    * **Remove the chuck key from the chuck when not actively using it**. Turning on the lathe while the chuck key is inserted will fling it directly into your face at high velocity.
    * **Metal parts will likely be hot** immediately after turning. Let them cool down.
    * **Files must have a proper handle.** If the lathe shoves the file back towards you, the tang of a file will cut right through your hand.

!!! warning "Prohibited Operations"
    * Modifying or hacking the lathe and its accessories without board approval.
    * Bypassing interlocks or safety features.
    * Cutting materials that may harm humans or equipment.
    * When cutting stringy materials like aluminum or Delrin, **DO NOT** try to clear the chips while the lathe is running. Turn the lathe off, clear the chips with pliers, then resume the operation.
    * Do not use a parting blade while the live or dead center is in use. The center will cause the work to pinch the blade, likely shattering it.
    * If using abrasives (i.e. emery cloth for polishing), the ways must remain covered with a towel. Abrasive grit damages the ways over time.
    * If turning wood, the ways must also be covered. Sawdust mixes with oil and turns into a sludge that gums up the machine.

### Disclaimer
Machining has a steep learning curve. This page is not a substitute for proper learning materials.

### Materials
While this is a metal lathe, some metals are vastly more difficult to work with than others. We strongly recommend starting with brass when first learning, as it cuts easily and forms good chips. Aluminum cuts similarly easily, but leaves a rats nest of ribbons behind. This lathe can cut mild steel but requires a very light depth of cut, slow feed rate and lots of cutting oil. A free machining steel such as 12L14 will make life a bit easier.

## Pre-flight checklist
!!! info "Before every use"
    1. Ensure the chuck key is not in the chuck.
    1. Ensure the chuck has a secure grip on the work.
    1. Ensure the tool post is fastened.
    1. Ensure the machine is well oiled.
    1. Disengage the half nut.

## Operation checklist
!!! info "During use"
    1. Be constantly mindful of the position of the tool and carriage. Constantly check to make sure you aren't in danger of crashing the lathe.
    1. Start with a very light cut and a slow feed.

## Post-flight checklist
!!! info "End of operation and clean-up"
    1. Clean up the work area. Metal chips are sharp and should only be handled with gloves.
    1. Cover up the lathe when done.
