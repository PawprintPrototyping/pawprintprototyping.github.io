# Description

_Move over JLCPCB!_

The pick and place machine is used to automatically assemble printed circuit boards (PCBs) that have been created in a board house like Oshpark, PCBWay, JLCPCB, etc. Some board houses offer assembly, but it comes at a fee and you are sometimes limited in the parts you can pick for your design. Our pick and place allows you to assemble PCBs with almost any part you can get, for free!

# Safety and Certification
